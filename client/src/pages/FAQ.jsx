      <h3>What is a drop?</h3>
      <p>
        A drop is a secure bundle of a message and optional file which can be accessed with a PIN before it expires or
        hits the download limit.
      </p>
      <h3>How secure is it?</h3>
      <p>
        We generate randomized PINs, store hashed tokens, and automatically remove files when expired or limits are
        reached.
      </p>
      <h3>What happens when the limit is reached?</h3>
      <p>The drop is deleted and the file removed from storage. Recipients will see that the limit has been reached.</p>
      <h3>What are the plan limits?</h3>
